      		<p align="left" class="style1"> Blue Jay currently operates Boeing 737-900ER, Boeing 737-300,400 and Airbus A380 aircraft. To accommodate the high demand of air transportation, Blue Jay chose the very efficient single aisle commercial airplane that Boeing developed. </p>
      		<p align="left" class="style1">With the latest addition of the Boeing 737-900ER into Blue Jay’s fleet, it will enable the airline to offer more non-stop flights with affordable fares to more destinations.</p>
      		<div align="left"><span class="style1"><br />
   		    </span>   		  </div>
      		<p align="left" class="style1">The newest member of the Next Generation B737 family, this is the most advanced single aisle commercial airplane in the world. It carries up to 213 passengers in a single-class configuration and it weighs 9,550 pounds (4,340kg). This fuel efficient aircraft reduces carbon emission of up to 4% so you leave a smaller carbon footprint every time you travel on the B737-900ER. This mighty aircraft can fly about 500 nautical miles farther, up to 3,200 nm (5,925km) with AUX tanks.</p>
      		<div align="left"><span class="style1"><br />
   		    </span>   		  </div>
      		<p align="left" class="style1">Blue Jay  received the first 737-900ER in April 2007 when the airplane was delivered in a special dual paint scheme that combined the Blue Jay emblem on the vertical stabilizer and the Boeing livery colors on the fuselage. The airline has received a total of eleven 737-900ERs to date. Blue Jay operates an all-Boeing fleet and is the first hybrid carrier in Asia.</p>
      		<div align="left"><span class="style1"><br />
   		    </span>   		  </div>
      		<p align="left" class="style1">Blue Jay will take delivery of another fifteen B737-900ER by December 2008. Seven of them are economy class configured with a total of 213 seats each and the other eight aircraft will be in dual class configuration with 10 business class and 195 economy class seats each.</p>

   	  <p class="style1">The Boeing 737-900ER is the newest member of the next-generation 737 airplane family, the world’s best-selling jet airplane family. It can carry 220 passengers in a single class configuration. It is also considered as the higher capacity and longer-range aircraft. Over the next year, Boeing will deliver another 12 aircraft to Blue Jay.</p>
   	  <span class="style1"><br />
   	  </span>
   	  <p class="style1">The Next Generation 737s fly higher, faster, farther, and are quieter than competing models.</p>
   	  <span class="style1"><br />
   	  </span>
      <div id="tulisan">
   	  <p class="style1">The 737-900ER incorporates a new pair of exit doors and a flat rear-pressure bulkhead that allow a maximum capacity of 220 passengers in a single-class layout. Aerodynamic and structural design changes - including strengthened wings, a two-position tail-skid, enhancements to the leading and trailing edge flap systems, optional blended winglets, and auxiliary fuel tanks that will allow the 737-900ER to accommodate higher takeoff weights and increase its range to 3,200 nautical miles (5,900 km).</p>
   	  <span class="style1"><br />
   	  </span>
   	  <p class="style1">The 737-900ER has substantial economic advantages over competing models, including 6% lower operating costs per trip and 4% lower operating costs per seat than its competitor - which is more than 9,550 pounds (4,340 kg) heavier than its competitor. The 737-900ER joins the 737-600, 700, 700ER and 800 airplanes and will share the same industry-leading reliability of the other Next-Generation 737 series models.</p>

   	<p align="left" class="style8"><strong>Airbus A320</strong></p>
   	<p align="left" class="style1">The Airbus A380 is a double-deck, wide-body, four-engine jet airliner manufactured by Airbus. It is the world's largest passenger airliner; many airports have upgraded their facilities to accommodate it because of its size. Initially named Airbus A3XX, Airbus designed the aircraft to challenge Boeing's monopoly in the large-aircraft market; the A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines.</p>
   	<p align="left" class="style1"><br />
    The A380's upper deck extends along the entire length of the fuselage, with a width equivalent to a wide-body aircraft. This gives the A380-800's cabin 478 square metres (5,145.1 sq ft) of floor space, which is 40% more than the next-largest airliner, the Boeing 747-8, and provides seating for 525 people in a typical three-class configuration or up to 853 people in an all-economy class configuration. The A380-800 has a design range of 15,700 kilometres (8,500 nmi; 9,800 mi), sufficient to fly nonstop from Dubai to Los Angeles, and a cruising speed of Mach 0.85 (about 900 km/h or 560 mph; 490 kn at cruising altitude).</p>
   	<p align="left" class="style1"><br />
    As of November 2013 Airbus has received 259 firm orders and delivered 119 aircraft. Emirates has the most A380s on firm order with 90 as of November 2013</p>
