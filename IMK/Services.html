      <p align="left" class="style5">Blue Jay  Experience is a new concept of service designed to allow     passengers to experience Indonesia at its best. From the moment they     make flight reservation until their arrival at the destination,     passengers of Blue Jay are pampered with a sincere and friendly     service, the epitome of Indonesian hospitality.<br />
        <br />
        By     introducing the concept of Blue Jay Experience, Blue Jay is creating a special brand identity for the company and at     the same time promoting Indonesia in the international level. The     concept of Blue Jay Experience is based on “5 senses” (sight,     sound, scent, taste, and touch) which includes 24 “customer touch     points”, from pre-journey, pre-flight, in-flight, post flight and post     journey services.<br />
        <br />
        Since     it was first launched in 2009, Blue Jay Experience has been     relying on Indonesian hospitality as its main base. This is in line   with   the vision of Blue Jay, to become a reliable airline   which is   offering high quality services to people around the world   with   Indonesian hospitality in its core. Blue Jay has a   special   mission, as the flag carrier of Indonesia which promotes   Indonesia to   the international society. The concept of Indonesian   hospitality is   applied into several icons designed to delight the five   senses. We can   see it on the unique Indonesian materials and   ornaments used for the   interior of the aircraft, the exotic scent of   Indonesian flowers, the   sound of Indonesian indigenous folk music and   the taste of Indonesian   traditional food and beverage. During 2009,   the company carried out   refurbishment program for its old fleet,   Boeing 747-400 , 737-900 and Airbus   380-300, by changing the design interior of   the aircrafts and adding   Audio Video On Demand (AVOD) facilities.   These steps are in line with   the concept of Blue Jay  Experience. <br />
        <br />
        Apart     from involving the five senses, the concept of Blue Jay    Experience should also includes these basic values: on-time and safe     (for product), prompt and precise (for process), clean and comfortable     (for premises) and relia`ble, professional, competent and helpful (for     staff). The concept has been widely accepted by the customers of Blue Jay.</p>
